                            direct, indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential damages or any damages
                            whatsoever including, without limitation, damages for loss of use, data or profits, arising
                            out of or in any way connected with the use or performance of the site, with the delay or
                            inability to use the site or related services, the provision of or failure to provide
                            services, or for any information, software, products, services and related graphics obtained
                            through the site, or otherwise arising out of the use of the site, whether based on
                            contract, tort, negligence, strict liability or otherwise, even if Avenger Delivery or any
                            of its suppliers has been advised of the possibility of damages. Because some
                            states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential
                            or incidental damages, the above limitation may not apply to you. If you are dissatisfied
                            with any portion of the site, or with any of these terms of use, your sole and exclusive
                            remedy is to discontinue using the site. <br>
                            <strong>Termination/access restriction</strong> <br>
                            Avenger Delivery reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate your access to the
                            Site and the related services or any portion thereof at any time, without notice. To the
                            maximum extent permitted by law, this agreement is governed by the laws of Vietnam and you
                            hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of courts in Vietnam in all disputes
                            arising out of or relating to the use of the Site. Use of the Site is unauthorized in any
                            jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these Terms, including, without
                            limitation, this section. <br>
                            You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists
                            between you and Avenger Delivery as a result of this agreement or use of the Site. Avenger
                            Delivery's performance of this agreement is subject to existing laws and legal process, and
                            nothing contained in this agreement is in derogation of Avenger Delivery's right to comply
                            with governmental, court and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use
                            of the Site or information provided to or gathered by Avenger Delivery with respect to such
                            use. If any part of this agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to
                            applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability
                            limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed
                            superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the
                            original provision and the remainder of the agreement shall continue in effect. <br>
                            Unless otherwise specified herein, this agreement constitutes the entire agreement between
                            the user and Avenger Delivery with respect to the Site and it supersedes all prior or
                            contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between
                            the user and Avenger Delivery with respect to the Site. A printed version of this agreement
                            and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative
                            proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the
                            same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained
                            in printed form. It is the express wish to the parties that this agreement and all related
                            documents be written in English. <br>
