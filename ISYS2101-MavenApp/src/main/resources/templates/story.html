                <p>At Avenger, our goal is to be more than just "A GreatÂ Restaurant."
                    Make the World Smile for Peace is our larger goal.
                    <br>
                    Delivering Wow, Sharing Happiness is our mission, which we adhere to and work for every day in order
                    to realize this vision.
                    <br>
                    Wow is the adjective used to describe wonderful surprises and the kind of events that make your
                    heart sing and leave you with a positive attitude and a driven spirit.
                    <br>
                    That enthusiasm and upbeat feeling serves as a significant step toward "Happiness."
                    <br>
                    We hope that by "Sharing" that with as many people as we can, joy will permeate everyone and fill
                    the entire planet.
                    <br>
                    A smile is the result of "Delivering Wow, Sharing Happiness."
                    The first thing we try to do is make the person in front of us smile. Then, we try to make that
                    smile last longer.
                    <br>
                    We think that if we keep taking those simple actions and more smiles appear everywhere, happiness
                    would eventually cover the entire globe.

                    Why don't we construct an oven in the backyard, I ask?
                    <br>
                    One day, the founder made a desire for him, and in an effort to fulfill it, he gathered his pals at
                    his house and decided to construct an oven.
                    This was our very first moment.
                    <br>
                    Friends who worked in various fields gathered every weekend to construct the oven by hand while
                    getting mucky and filthy like children. They took over six months to do the task.
                    <br>
                    The party kicked off once the oven was constructed.
                    <br>
                    The oven was the focal point of the party, which friends had invited friends to.
                    Everyone prepared their own unique dish, shared them with others, and got giddy over who had the
                    finest one.
                    <br>
                    The allure of dish and the enchantment of the oven immediately drew everyone together.
                    People making connections and smiling as a result.
                    <br>
                    Dish originated and spread throughout the world, evolving into many different shapes and styles.
                    It has gained popularity across age, gender, and geographic boundaries.
                    The straightforward, cost-free, and adaptable recipe captured the hearts of the entrepreneur and his
                    friends.
                    <br>
                    "From something as modest as this, we may start enriching hearts and bringing joy to all."
